# Contributing to CapLang

Thanks for your interest. This project is small and easy to get started with.

Suggested areas to contribute:
- Extend the parser to support statements (assignments, `if`, `def` for functions).
- Add a small standard library (I/O helpers, `puts`/`print`).
- Add tests for lexer/parser/interpreter/compiler.

How to run locally

1. Edit or add code under `src/`
2. Add examples in `examples/`
3. Run the interpreter or compiler via `python3 src/run.py <file> --mode run|compile`

Pull requests
- Target `main` branch. Keep changes small and focused.

Code style
- Use consistent spacing and follow the existing style in `src/`.
