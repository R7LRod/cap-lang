# Update Log â€” CapLang v1.1.2

Date: 2025-10-25

## Summary

This minor release adds a CapLang -> Python compiler CLI, explicit runtime type-casting builtins, and small improvements to the compiler's emitted code (notably mapping `sleep(...)` to `time.sleep(...)`). Documentation and examples were updated accordingly.

## New Features
- `bin/capla-compile`: a lightweight CLI wrapper that compiles `.capla` sources into standalone Python files.
- Type-casting builtins in the interpreter: `int(x)`, `float(x)`, `string(x)` / `str(x)`, and `bool(x)`.

## Compiler improvements
- `sleep(...)` is compiled to `time.sleep(...)`; generated Python files automatically `import time` when needed.

## Documentation
- Updated `docs/added_features.md` to document the casts and compiler CLI.
- Updated `README.md` quickstart to show `bin/capla-compile` usage.

## Testing & Verification
- Compiled examples with the new CLI and ran the generated Python files to verify behavior.
- Ran interpreter and compiled modes for relevant examples (hello, math, complex) and confirmed outputs matched expectations.

## Known issues
- Casts currently call runtime helper functions; compiler emits these calls rather than native Python casts. This may be optimized in a future release.

## Future plans
- Emit native Python casts for `int`/`float`/`str`/`bool` when compiling for improved performance.
- Add optional input helpers such as `input_int()` / `input_float()` to make interactive scripts more ergonomic.
